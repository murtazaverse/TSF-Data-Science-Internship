# Data Science and Business Analytics Internship
## Task 1: Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning
In this task we have to predict the percentage score of a student based on the number of hours studied. This task can be solved through simple linear regression since it has two variables.

## Task 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
In this task, we have to predict the optimum number of clusters in IRIS dataset and represent them visually. It is an unsupervised machine learning task and it is solved through K-means clustering.
